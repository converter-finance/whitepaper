### Converter.Finance: The First Leveraged Yield Aggregator on Huobi Eco Chain
### 1.1 Decentralized finance
DeFi is short for decentralized finance, also known as open finance. It actually refers
to decentralized protocols used to build an open financial system, which aims to
enable anyone in the world to conduct financial activities anytime and anywhere.
In the existing financial system, financial services, such as deposits, withdrawals,
loans, and derivatives, are mainly controlled and regulated by central organizations.
DeFi attempts to establish a transparent and accessible peer-to-peer financial
system through distributed open source protocols to minimize trust risks and make it
easier and more convenient for participants to obtain financial services.

Compared with traditional centralized financial systems, DeFi has three major
advantages: <br/>

A. Individuals can build new trust on computers and codes without trusting any
intermediary;<br/>
B. Participate "without permission", anyone can create DeFi applications, and
anyone can use them. Unlike the centralized finance, there are no guards or lengthy
accounts in Defi. Users interact directly with smart contracts through their
cryptocurrency wallets. Everyone has the right to participate.<br/>
C. All protocols are open source, so that anyone can cooperate on the protocol to
develop new financial adoptions and accelerate financial innovation through the
network effect.<br/>

DeFi is a relatively general concept, including: currency issuance, trading and
settlement, lending, trading, investment and financing, etc.

### 1.2 DeFi yields aggregator
In the Internet age, aggregators capture most of the use value. Google has brought
together the content of various websites, Facebook has brought together social
media associations and content, Amazon has brought together products and sales,
and Airbnb has brought together hotel rooms... The Internet giant has overturned
traditional industries and has built a near monopoly influence. As more and more
customers, content and products are gathered, its marginal cost is close to zero, and
a network effect is generated on this basis. Thus forming a huge moat, and the
result is that a winner takes all.

Obviously, some DeFi protocols have begun to explore the path of "aggregation".
Although it is still in its early stage, we can already see that some DeFi aggregators
have begun to be applied in many subdivisions, such as: <br/>
A. Yield-optimizer. It can automatically balance user deposit income according to the
interest rates of different DeFi platforms; <br/>
B. Smart order router. It can provide traders with the best price execution according
to different DEX; <br/>
C. Meta-asset. It tries to integrate other assets (such as USD stablecoin) to reducethe non-systematic risks of any independent entity; <br/>
D. Interface. It packages all DeFi products into a more user-friendly application so
that they can access more high-end features or portfolio management tools. Most
importantly, these projects can aggregate users* needs and then screen them
through different DeFi protocols.

The cryptocurrency industry is developing at a very fast pace. A hot topic today may
have nothing to do with the next hot topic. Few DeFi projects can become a
continuous industry theme. All these fluctuations will have a dramatic impact on the
market infrastructure, so it will make it difficult for DeFi infrastructure development to
keep up with market development. Many people who work full-time in the DeFi
infrastructure field are also aware of the difficulty. For those who allocate funds in the
DeFi field, the infrastructure issue is also very important, because it raises many
other questions, such as: Which lending platform allows you to get the most
benefits? Which DEX can provide the lowest slippage? Which stable coins can
ensure long-term security?

Not only that, these variables are constantly changing, making it increasingly difficult
for us to know the correct answers to these questions. Therefore, the appearance of
DeFi aggregator seems to be just the right time. With the help of aggregators, users
do not have to worry about finding which DeFi platform is the most suitable one and
which platform can ensure the best benefits in the entire ecosystem. They do not
need to compare and select DeFi protocols one by one. DeFi aggregator can
automatically find the most suitable investment target. In the DeFi field, we have
begun to see that some products have a good market/product fit. This statement is
not groundless, because currently about 20% of the DEX transaction volume on
Ethereum is routed through DEX aggregators , where InstaDApp has locked in more
than 7% of the total value of DeFi.

Yearn Finance is a DeFi yield aggregator that runs on Ethereum blockchain and it is
a combination product of the yield optimization protocol and the DeFi project. After it
launched the governance Token YFI on July 17th, it quickly detonated the liquid
mining market due to its novel distribution mechanism and governance scheme. YFI
is distributed entirely through liquidity mining, without pre-mining or pre-sale.

YFI has the best supply distribution in the history of the DeFi community. Everyone
who earns tokens bears the same risk, and all information will be provided to
everyone for free. This fair launch is reminiscent of the early Bitcoin mining, because
no one has the first mover advantage-not even the founder Andre, the only way to
get YFI token is liquid mining. Just like the early Bitcoin miners, the early YFI miners
themselves chose to become the most suitable participants for DeFi, ensuring the
enthusiasm and participation of the community.

### 1.3 Huobi ECO Chain (Heco)
Ethereum's congestion is due to strong demand. When the demand cannot be fully
satisfied, it is a normal and natural phenomenon to find other alternative ways to
solve the demand. Huobi ECO Chain (Heco) is a decentralized, high-efficiency and
energy-saving public chain. It is also the first product launched on the Huobi Open
Platform. It supports high-performance transactions and realizes the compatibility of
smart contracts. The original digital asset of Heco is HT, which uses the HPOS
consensus mechanism. 

For most users, the transaction fees of decentralized applications and the
interoperability of assets are still a huge problem for participating in the Ethereum
ecosystem. The emergence of Heco makes this problem a thing of the past. Heco
will efficiently link users, assets and decentralized applications, greatly reducing the
threshold for application landing and growth, allowing users and developers to enjoy
an efficient and low-cost on-chain experience. For developers, Heco has the
following features: <br/>

A. An open and decentralized network to maintain the security of the network and
assets; <br/>
B. Support the programmability of EVM, the compatibility of smart contracts, and
reduce development and maintenance costs;
C. Meta-transaction function, fee reduction and exemption, further reduce the cost of
developers and users on the chain; <br/>
D. HPOS consensus mechanism, block generation in 3 seconds, speeding up
consensus; <br/>
E. Cross-chain asset transfer to optimize asset cross-chain experience.

Converter.Finance is a yield aggregator protocol based on the Heco public chain. In
this article, we will introduce how Converter.Finance, as a decentralized system,
creates secure leverage positions and finds the highest yield strategy to increase the
positive rate of return.

### 2.1 Converter.Finance introduction
Converter.Finance is a leveraged yield aggregation and leveraged liquidity provision
protocol to help users optimize DeFi yields. It will increase leverage for
users, investment to maximize financial returns when the risk is low. When users
deposit assets, Converter will automatically find the chain protocol with the highest
yield to invest. The loan interest rate comes from the liquidity provider borrowing
these assets to generate the interest rate for providing liquidity. Users can obtain
higher income APY and transaction fees APY by taking on leveraged income
agricultural positions. Through leverage, Converter.Finance will borrow designated
assets on behalf of users to generate income farms. Liquidity providers can obtain
higher transaction fees APY by assuming leveraged liquidity to provide positions.
Through leverage, Converter.Finance will borrow designated assets on behalf of
users to provide liquidity. Liquidators can get a 5% reward by liquidating positions
with a debt ratio of 100%.

### 2.2 Operating mechanism
Users stake their assets in Converter.Finance. Converter.Finance looks for the best
financial management strategy in the market to help users obtain safe and reliable
high income. The main sources of yield include: <br/>
1) Fundamental investment income, for example, adding LP will get a
transaction fee commission reward;
2) The token rewards of the yield farming, some investment or staking can get
token incentives, and Converter.Finance will also get corresponding benefits;
3) Token incentives of Converter.Finance

### 2.3 Instructions for use
Users can view all important information by viewing the information page. Once a
user opens a position, the user needs to monitor and manage your position to
prevent liquidation. Liquidation is performed when debt ratio = 100%.

<center>Debt ratio = borrowing credit / mortgage credit</center>

The actions that users can take to manage locations are as follows:
<strong>Add</strong>: The add operation will allow the user to stake more collateral to an existing
position. Users may wish to do this to keep the debt ratio below 100%.<br/>
<strong>Delete</strong>: The delete operation will allow the user to partially withdraw the collateral
from the position and repay the loan.<br/>
If the collateral is withdrawn (the loan is not repaid), the debt ratio will increase
because the borrowing credit remains the same, but the collateral credit decreases.<br/>
If you repay the loan (without taking out the mortgage), the debt ratio will decrease
because the borrowing credit is reduced and the mortgage credit remains the same.
<strong>Harvest</strong>: The harvest action will allow the user to obtain the obtained token.<br/>
<strong>Liquidation</strong>: The liquidation operation will close the entire position, automatically
repay all debts, and return the remaining assets to the user.

### 2.4 Mining strategy
There are two mining modes: liquidity mining and leveraged liquidity mining.

<strong>A. Liquidity mining</strong> <br/>
The lending incentive model generally motivates both deposits and borrowings, but it
also has the risk of liquidation. For this reason, Converter.finance adopts a single
currency mining method for the lending platform, and the specific strategy adopted is:
1. Strategy to deposit tokens to the lending platform;
2. Strategy to borrow tokens from lending platforms;
3. The lent tokens are then deposited on the lending platform;
4. The mortgaged assets increase, and continue to borrow tokens, and so on.

Because they are deposits and loans in the same token, there is no risk of
liquidation.However, the assets on the lending platform will be enlarged, and the
product of the enlargement varies according to the pledge rate. A pledge rate of 70%
can increase the assets to about 2-3 times.

<strong>B. Leveraged liquidity mining</strong> <br/>
Users can use leverage when participating in liquidity mining, and the strategy will be
launched in the second phase. The basic steps of this strategy are as follows:
1. The user deposits the assets on the platform to form a position;
2. The platform uses its own pool of funds to allocate funds to users (USDT or HT);
3. Convert user information and platform allocation funds into target tokens;
4. Add the target token to the liquidity pool;
5. Obtain income by staking LP Token;
6. Users can obtain higher returns through leverage (tentatively 1.5 times to 3 times);
7. The user's token is collected automatically, and the platform will not sell the token
to help the user reinvest.
   
C. The first batch of liquidity mining support MDX LP tokens MDX/USDT, HT/USDT;
MDX boardroom LP mining; MDX Boardroom single token HT, MDX mining;

### 2.5 Understanding the debt ratio
When debt ratio = 100%, leveraged positions (greater than 1x) will be liquidated.
Converter.Finance uses the concepts of mortgage credit and borrowing credit to
determine the assets that are given as collateral and the assets to be borrowed, as
well as the leverage that can be obtained. Through this mechanism,
Converter.Finance can set parameters according to the volatility of each asset, and
set different buffer parameters for different assets to ensure the security of the
protocol.

Note 1: The mortgage credit and loan credit in Converter.Finance are different from
the concept of LTV used in other lending agreements.
Mortgage credit: Each asset has its own mortgage credit value. Mortgage credit
value determines how much credit is obtained from asset mortgages. Note: The
collateral is only withdrawn from the liquidity provided in step 1 when the position is
opened.

Lending credit: Each asset also has its own lending credit. The borrowed credit line
determines how much credit is consumed by the borrowed asset (obtained by
collateralizing the asset). The mortgage credit and loan credit of assets depend on
the volatility of asset prices. If assets are unstable, mortgage credit will be low and
borrowing credit will be high. For example, if a user provides HT as collateral for
borrowing HUSD, he will be able to lend more HUSD instead of lending YFI (or any
less stable asset) through other means.

Note 2: Even if the debt ratio = 100% (the position is in liquidation risk), the position
is still not underwater. Converter.Finance has another buffer layer that allows more
price fluctuations before the position becomes underwater before it is cleared.
In order to keep the debt ratio below 100% to prevent placing the position at
liquidation risk, the loan can be repaid by hoping to add collateral. The user can also
close his position, which will close the position, automatically repay all debts, and
return the remaining assets to the user.

### 2.6 Risk control
Like any lending activity, Converter.Finance has its own risks. For non-leveraged
liquidity providers (open positions at 1 times the price), they will face the risk of
impermanent losses. Please note that all stablecoins (such as the Curve Spool
composed of USDT, USDC and DAI) have the least risk of permanent loss in the
pool. For liquidity providers with leverage (open positions greater than 1 times), they
also face the risk of impermanent losses, and the level of leverage will magnify
impermanent losses. In addition, due to impermanent losses and the fact that users
assume leverage, user positions are also subject to liquidation risk.

When the debt ratio = 100%, the position will face liquidation risk. Any liquidator who
is at risk of liquidation can liquidate your position. When the liquidator liquidates your
position, 5% of the value of the position will be rewarded to the liquidator. The value
of the position will be used to repay all debts. The remaining position value will then
be refunded to the user who has liquidated the position.

### 3. Token Economy
The Converter.Finance token code is CON, and the CON token incentive will remain
long-term and provide incentives for effective user behavior. The total supply is 48.8
million, each block will produce 2.6 CONs, and the production will be reduced by 7%
every 30 days. Such reduction will suspend until each block generates 0.26 CON. All
tokens will be produced with the output of the block.

<strong>CON distribution rules:</strong><br>
• 85% for motivating users to provide liquidity and for the ecological governance DAO
funds, of which<br>
-6%-12% for liquidity mining<br>
-DAO funds: Since the first reduction in production, 1% of the liquidity mining output
is allocated to the DAO funds. Every time the production is reduced, the
percentage will increase by 1% until it reaches 20%.DAO funds constitute an
important way for such ecosystem governance. Users who hold CON can participate
in the governance of the Converter ecosystem. The use of DAO funds is initiated by
the community and determined by community voting. The funds serve all measures
beneficial to the development of the Converter.Finance ecosystem, for
example, incentivizing community developers and serving users.<br>
• 5% for early investors;<br>
• 5% for foreign cooperation and operation;<br>
• and 5% for the long-term development of Converter.Finance.
Rate:<br>
A. 15%-35% of yields will be charged as a platform fee<br>
B. According to different strategies, users will be charged a 0-0.2% transaction fee
for withdrawal. 99% of the fee will be used to repurchase and destroy CON, and
1% will be reserved as the risk reserve of the platform, and its use is determined
by community governance.
